A new pulsar signal processing pipeline is developed for observing pulsars using the Diamond Array Radio Telescope (DART) in the Gauribidanur radio observatory (13.604 N, 77.427 E). The array consists of 32 off-axis dual-polarised LPDAs, with a nominal gain of 22 dBi between 130 and 350 MHz and a 15-degree HPBW at 175 MHz, and it performs transit observations on pulsars. Custom-developed analogue signal conditioning, transmission, and a digital backend are incorporated to record the data. A real-time data-capture and analysis tool has been developed that receives band-limited time series data and outputs voltages from a transient buffer, as well as full-polar spectral data in both high and low resolutions, suitable for transient search and pulsar studies. Additionally, full-polar folded profile archives are generated for known pulsars with subintegrations and by both coherent and incoherent dedispersions. An all-day monitoring is implemented that continuously records a one-second averaged spectrum. Custom-developed Python routines, FFT libraries, DSPSR, PSRCHIVE, and Presto modules have been used to build the pipeline. The functionalities of the pipeline were validated with artificially generated pulsar signals and strong celestial sources before it was released for routine observations. Presently, the pipeline is configured to observe pulsars between 170 and 196 MHz, with a daily cadence. Recorded data are reduced in-line immediately following each observation, nearly matching the observation time at a 1:1 ratio. An Intel i9 server captures the data, and an AMD R9 CPU does the primary data reduction. The archives are routinely backed up to a remote system via the internet. The paper presents the architecture of the signal processing pipeline developed, its validation, and initial polarimetric results observing five bright pulsars at 175 MHz. Results also include RM estimates and single-pulse study results for B0953+08, B0531+21, and B1133+16, as well as from monitoring the spin-down of the Crab pulsar over 200 days of observation. Finally, it presents a discussion on the potential improvements for the array.
